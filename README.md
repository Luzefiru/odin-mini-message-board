# odin-mini-message-board

A mini-message board built with Express.js and the EJS templating engine.

# Deploying on [Render.com](render.com)

Render was my chosen PaaS due to their free tier of 750 monthly hours that automatically shuts down after 15 minutes, allowing me to save on hosting costs for small projects.
